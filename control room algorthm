Algorithm ControlRoom_Pathfinding
Step 1: Load system map (nodes = vehicles + gateways, edges = connections).
Step 2: For each vehicle request:
    - Define start_node = vehicle_position
    - Define target_node = gateway_position
Step 3: Initialize priority_queue with start_node (cost = 0).
Step 4: While priority_queue not empty:
    - Extract node with lowest cost
    - For each neighbor:
        - Calculate new_cost = current_cost + edge_weight
        - If new_cost < stored_cost:
            - Update stored_cost
            - Save predecessor
            - Push neighbor into queue
Step 5: Stop when target_node reached.
Step 6: Reconstruct path using predecessors.
Step 7: Send path to Gateway module.
Step 8: Monitor execution; if obstacle detected → re-run algorithm.
